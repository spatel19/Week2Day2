# Challenge: flexbox

## Instructions

1. Create a ["holy grail" layout][grail] using Flexbox (read
   [this][background] for some background if you're curious).
1. Make it responsive. Use only flexbox, no bootstrap. The content (i.e.
   everything excluding the header) should be rearranged like this on
   small devices:

   Large: ![big]
   Small: ![small]
1. Create the following layout, also using flexbox, then make it
   responsive (i.e., clone the live version):
